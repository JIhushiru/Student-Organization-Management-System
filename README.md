CMSC 127 Final Project

Project Overview<br/>
studentary is an information system designed to streamline the management of student organizations, including their events, memberships, and finances. It offers a user-friendly interface tailored to different user roles to ensure convenient and efficient access to relevant information. Admin users have full access to the system. They can create user accounts, manage the database, and oversee all organizations. Organization Presidents have more limited access, allowing them to edit and delete member information within their respective organizations. Regular members, on the other hand, can only view their own fee records. The system is developed using Python and MariaDB.<br/>
